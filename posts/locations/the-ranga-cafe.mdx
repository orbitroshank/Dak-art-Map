While taking a walk with Tony, this café caught my eye due to the artistic method of shading the seats and the giant "OFF" sign. After further research, the café is part of Hapsatou Sy's brand, a female entrepreneur in Paris who is involved in the arts and beauty. The space signifies what I loved about the OFF program-- anything and everything was art. You could not walk down a street without seeing the OFF sign attached to some sort of artsy thing. It was EVERYWHERE (and I feel like I still see some OFF signs around Dakar, months later!) The city became art.
