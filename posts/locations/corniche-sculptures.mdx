When occasionally going to the Baie de Mermoz, I love seeing the sculptures. While I don't have a photo of it, the type of materials used are on display. A few times, I have been able to chat with artists working on their stone sculptures-- it's special to me that I can see how the pieces are being made like that. One day, I really want to send a message to one of the artists to ask them about their work!
