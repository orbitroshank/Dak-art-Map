I went here with Eli after visiting the Ancien Palais de Justice for the second time. I met up with my friend (who used to work at ELI as a secretary) Abibatou, there. She introduced us to her friends who were featured in the Biennale there! We ended up taking a painting class with Mouhamed Jawad Ly and his brother. We got a private tour of their studio, getting to flip through their sketchbooks and talk about their artistic process. It was an absolutely amazing experience and one of the highlights of my program.
