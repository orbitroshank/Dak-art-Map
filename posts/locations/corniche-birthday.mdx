While my school friends and I were leaving Mim's (a very nice restaurant) after the first part of Chloé's birthday celebration, we saw both of these murals. The first stunned me with it's vibrant color, and the second due to the message and rock pattern. The texture, especially with the paint colors used, reminds me of fish scales. These art pieces, in my opinion, add so much to the experience of walking along the Corniche.
