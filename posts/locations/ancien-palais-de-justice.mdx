I visited the Ancien Palais de Justice twice this year, both times during the 2024 Dakar Biennale. The first time, I went with Ruby and our friend Zaakiya (it was actually the first time meeting Zaakiya, who would become a closer friend throughout the year). The second was with the other 3 in the program and YES alum Khadissa. I really needed both times to fully see everything (I think and hope) exhibited in the grand space. It was a bit of a maze at times. I hope to visit again (especially during a future Biennale)!
