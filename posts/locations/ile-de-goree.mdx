Walking up the narrow cobblestone lanes of Gorée Island, the weight of history presses in: centuries of human suffering took place there. Today, it is home to a thriving artistic community. There are numerous galleries, as well as art on the side of walkways and a small art market. When I was there for the first time with the program, we watched a sand painting demonstration (it was very impressive technique!). I ended up buying my first souvenir from the artists that create these sand paintings (which I am not opening until I bring it back to the VI). The third time I was there, with family, was during the Biennale. While I didn't get to take photos due to my iPhone being dead, there were both ON and OFF exhibitions on the island. One of the most impressive ones I saw was from a photographer.
