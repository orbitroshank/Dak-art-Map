The Museum of Black Civilizations was incredible to walk through! The first floor had archeological and historical items (like the skeletons of old types of humans). Above that, art (mostly not paintings-- a lot of masks and 3D objects) were displayed above the first floor. I wish I had visited again during the Biennale!
